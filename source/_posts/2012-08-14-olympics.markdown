So, the Olympic Games of London are over.  
It was kinda hard to follow such an event,
especially when it was happening in a complete different timezone (9 hours later than Japan, in fact).

The Japanese coverage focussed on, obviously, Japanese olympians, but totally eclipsed all the other participating countries. The media deemed it not worthy to lose a single word on other medallists when they were not Japanese, nor did the media cover any sports where Japanese sportives did not take in, or where eliminated from.  
Hence, the more interesting sports like Canoeing and Kayaking, Rowing, Beach Volleyball, Taekwondo, and a lot more were not even shown on (public) TV.  

As a comparison, TV media in Germany is showing the whole event, unrelated to the sportives' nation. (Especially when following the event on Eurosport).

So, I'm more than just pissed on these nationalistic media coverage of a major international sports event.

Next time, I'm gonna stream the events through a european proxy.

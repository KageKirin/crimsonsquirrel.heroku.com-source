It's summer in Japan.  
Meaning, it's way too hot for
the typical Northern European human being.  
Although, I do approve of the sun and the heat,
it's hard to cope with those 80+% of ambient humidity.

Ah, the heat, especially when you're in Tokyo,
you'll notice a couple of physical laws in action:

The reflection of sun rays on the glass surfaces, the concrete building,
and finally on the asphalt, creating a kind of environmental oven
to cook humans in it.

The hot air that gets blasted out by the "coolers" (climatisations),
and that highly contributes to heating the lower atmosphere in the city.

The biological reaction to heat:  
Well, humans sweat when it's hot.
Meaning, all the corporal bacteriae get a nice extra feeding,
and as a result, proliferate.
And since the 20th century invention of "deodorant" has
not arrived in Japan yet to the point of being ubiqutious,
the Japanese men (mostly) are smelly.  
But not the nice type of smelly,
but the rather inadequate type of bad corporal odor that makes the bystander want to puke.  
Sadly, the trains are full of this type of "salarymen" (mostly),
so the only hope to survive a train ride in these conditions is to be tall enough (my case)
and to be standing below the overly cold air blaster in the train.

The ambient heat has one nice point, though:  
the cute exemplary of Japanese females are wearing very short
and very light clothes. ;)



But the maybe biggest drawback of the heat is the heat induced  unability of thorough sleep at nightâ€¦
In short: I want a new ice age!


Tourist guide: Best places to spend the summer around Tokyo:

-   shopping malls, department stores, everywhere where it's climatised.
-   Hokkaido. It has a different climate. (Ok, it's NOT around Tokyo).
-   The Shonan beaches, located on the backside of the Miyura peninsula (the backyard of Yokohama), and close to famours tourist spots like Kamakura and Enoshima. It's also a short distance resolt to all people from Tokyo, and apparently a good mating sport for Westerners.
-   The Kisarazu region and the beaches in the Chiba prefecture. Located just on the other side of the Tokyo bay. The southern cap is a nice spot for surfers.
-   The samller islands of the Kanto region, like Ohshima. Also a very famous tourist spot, and hence potentially overcrowded.

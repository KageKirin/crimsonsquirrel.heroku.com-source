Hi, I'm Chris and I'm a german expatriate living in Japan.
I work in the games industry as a graphics programmer.

This blog and the rants I post here are the expression of my own views, and neither of my current nor any former employers.

Crimson Squirrel comes from transcriving my name into Japanese, which gives "Kurisu", which closest kanji form is "紅栗鼠", meaning crimson squirrel.
